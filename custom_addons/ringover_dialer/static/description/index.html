      <h2 class="">Does Odoo integrate with VoIP?</h2>
      <p>
        Odoo does integrate with VoIP. Though Odoo does offer a VoIP widget,
        integrating Odoo with a VoIP service like Ringover will ensure a higher
        quality of calls, a large selection of sophisticated features for

        to 110&nbsp;destinations. Because Odoo is open source, it can offer
        flexibility to those who want to customize their workflow software, but
        such a project would require significant technical resources, like
        personnel, on hand.

      <h2 class="">Can you make phone calls from Odoo?</h2>
      <p>
        Odoo has a VoIP widget that allows users to make phone calls, but it
        does not include many more functions than just making or receiving
        calls. That's why a

          VoIP phone system
        </a>
        would be a better solution for businesses who want more than just a
        basic phone calling function. VoIP phone providers ensure you have easy
        access to

      <h2 class="">What is Odoo CRM integration?</h2>
      <p>
        Odoo CRM integration is technology that allows for Odoo to connect or
        integrate to other business software. Odoo integrations with software
        like Ringover create a more robust tech stack for businesses. For
        example, integrating Odoo CRM with Ringover's VoIP software ensures that
        Odoo users will be able to call contacts with one click thanks to the
        click-to-call function. This
        <a href="https://www.ringover.com/integrations" target="_blank" class="ro_u-inline-link">
          integration
        </a>
        will also eliminate the need for users to enter the same data twice, as
        data synchronizes automatically and in real time between the two apps.

      <h2 class="">Does Odoo have a customer success tool?</h2>
      <p>
        Odoo does not have a customer success tool to capture user information,
        provide insights about how to enhance the customer experience, and
        engage customers. The Odoo app has functionalities in multiple
        categories, including website management, sales, finance, inventory and
        manufacturing, human resources, marketing, services, and productivity.
